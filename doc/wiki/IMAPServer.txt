Dovecot as an IMAP server
=========================

Dovecot was optimized since the beginning to work as an efficient IMAP server.
Dovecot supports a lot of IMAP extensions [http://imapwiki.org/Specs].

Some of the extensions need to be explicitly enabled:

 * <METADATA> [ImapMetadata.txt]
 * <COMPRESS> [Plugins.Compress.txt]
 * <SEARCH=FUZZY> [Plugins.FTS.txt]
 * <SPECIAL-USE> [MailboxSettings.txt]
 * NOTIFY: Set mailbox_list_index=yes
 * URLAUTH: Set imap_urlauth_host and mail_attribute_dict
