Dovecot Lua support
===================

Since v2.3.0 dovecot supports Lua scripting. Currently the only supported
feature is <Lua based authentication> [AuthDatabase.Lua.txt]. Dovecot supports
lua 5.0 or newer.

lib-lua
-------

Dovecot provides a lib-lua internal helper as part of libdovecot.so. It has
facilities for loading scripts from various sources, and also helps with
reusing scripts by keeping track of which scripts are loaded. Each script has
it's own memory pool, which is guaranteed to be released when script is
unloaded.

When script is loaded, *script_load* function is called if found. This can
return non-zero to indicate that the script has a problem.

Implementers can choose to call *dlua_register_dovecot* which registers a
global variable called *dovecot* which holds following items:

Logging:

 * i_debug(text)
 * i_error(text)
 * i_info(text)
 * i_warning(text)

This item can also be extended by context specific tables, like authentication
database adds *dovecot.auth*.
