Welcome plugin
==============

Requires v2.2.25+. Call a script when the user logs in for the first time. This
is specifically done when the INBOX is (auto)created. The scripts are called
similarly to <quota warning scripts> [Quota.Configuration.txt].

plugin {
  welcome_script = welcome %u
  # By default we run the script asynchronously, but with this option we
  # wait for the script to finish.
  #welcome_wait = yes
}

service welcome {
  executable = script /usr/local/bin/welcome.sh
  user = dovecot
  unix_listener welcome {
    user = vmail
  }
}

mail_plugins = $mail_plugins welcome
