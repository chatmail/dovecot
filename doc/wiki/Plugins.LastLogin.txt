Last Login Plugin
=================

Requires v2.2.14+. This plugin can be used to easily update user's last-login
timestamp in the configured <dictionary> [Dictionary.txt]. Configuration:

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
protocol imap {
  mail_plugins = $mail_plugins last_login
}
protocol pop3 {
  mail_plugins = $mail_plugins last_login
}

plugin {
  last_login_dict = redis:host=127.0.0.1:port=6379
  #last_login_key = last-login/%u # default
}
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that we enable last_login plugin explicitly only for imap & pop3
protocols. If enabled globally, it'll also update the timestamp whenever new
mails are delivered via lda/lmtp or when doveadm is run for the user. This can
also be thought of as a feature, so if you want to update a different timestamp
for user when new mails are delivered, you can do that by enabling the
last_login plugin also for lda/lmtp and changing the last_login_key setting.
