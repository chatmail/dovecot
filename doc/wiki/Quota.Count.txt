Count quota
===========

(Requires Dovecot v2.2.19+)

The quota is tracked internally within Dovecot's index files. Each mailbox's
quota is tracked separately and when the current quota usage is wanted to be
known, the mailboxes' quotas are summed up together. To get the best
performance mailbox list indexes should be enabled.

Configuration
-------------

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
mailbox_list_index = yes
plugin {
  # 10MB quota limit
  quota = count:User quota
  quota_rule = *:storage=10M

  # This is required - it uses "virtual sizes" rather than "physical sizes" for
quota counting:
  quota_vsizes = yes
}
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
