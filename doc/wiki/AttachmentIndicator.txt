Attachment indicator
====================

Since 2.2.34/2.3.1 dovecot has a feature that indicates whether email has an
attachment or not via keywords. These keywords could be used by IMAP clients.
These keywords will likely become standardized - for now the latest information
is in https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/imapext/current/msg05858.html

Configuration
-------------

To enable this feature, you can set *mail_attachment_detection_options*.

It supports following options

 * add-flags-on-save - Enables the feature, attachments are detected and marked
   during save
 * content-type=type|!type - Include or exclude given content type. Including
   will only negate an exclusion (e.g. content-type=!foo/*
   content-type=foo/bar).
 * exclude-inlined - Do not consider any attachment with disposition inlined.

Usage
-----

Once enabled, mails that are saved, are marked with $Has ''Attachment or $Has
''No ''Attachment keyword. These keywords can be cleared, and are not
protected. Since v2.3.3 it is possible to post-process attachments with
'doveadm rebuild attachments' command.
