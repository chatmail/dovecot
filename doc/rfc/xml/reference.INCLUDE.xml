<t>The Sieve Email Filtering "include" extension permits users to include one Sieve script inside another.  This can make managing large scripts or multiple sets of scripts much easier, and allows a site and its users to build up libraries of scripts.  Users are able to include their own personal scripts or site-wide scripts. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract></front>
