Subject: Questions regarding RFC 5228

Hello,

I am finishing up a first release of my Sieve implementation, and one of 
the TODO items that yet remains is getting some answers to questions 
that arose during development. I've collected these into a file an now I 
submit them to this list to get some clarification. Any help is greatly 
appreciated.

* RFC 5228 (Sieve) : 5.1.  Test address:
"Implementations MUST restrict the address test to headers that contain 
addresses, but MUST include at least From, To, Cc, Bcc, Sender, 
Resent-From, and Resent-To, and it SHOULD include any other header that 
utilizes an "address-list" structured header body."
   
  -> Will this cause a compile error, or are the disallowed headers 
simply ignored? My implementation currently considers this to be a 
compile error.
  -> Given the variables extension, sometimes the specified header names 
aren't known until runtime. If the previous answer was to cause a 
compile error, should this abort the script at runtime?
    
* RFC 5228 (Sieve) : 5.4.  Test envelope:
"The "envelope" test is true if the specified part of the [SMTP] (or 
equivalent) envelope matches the specified key.  This specification 
defines the interpretation of the (case insensitive) "from" and "to" 
envelope-parts.  Additional envelope-parts may be defined by other 
extensions; implementations SHOULD consider unknown envelope parts an 
error."
   
  -> Given the variables extension, sometimes the specified envelope 
parts aren't known until runtime. Should invalid ones abort the script 
or is ignoring them a better practice?

Regards,
