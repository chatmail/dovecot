<t>
This document defines a new vendor-defined action command "report" for the
"Sieve" email filtering language. It provides the means to send
Messaging Abuse Reporting Format (MARF) reports (RFC 5965). This format is
intended for communications regarding email abuse and related issues. The
"report" command allows (partially) automating the exchange of these reports,
which is particularly useful when the Sieve script is executed for an IMAP event
(RFC 6785) that is triggered by direct user action.

<section title="Introduction">
<t>This is an extension to the Sieve filtering language defined by
<xref target="SIEVE">RFC 5228</xref>. It provides the means to send
<xref target="MARF">Messaging Abuse Reporting Format (MARF)</xref> report
messages. This format is intended to exchange reports on abuse and related
issues.</t>

<t>This extension adds the "report" action command, which sends a MARF report to
the indicated recipient address. The author of the Sieve script must also
specify a human-readable messsage and the type of the report. The recipient is
usually an automated system that will take the appropriate action based on the
report.
</t>

<t>Normally, Sieve scripts are executed at message delivery. In that case,
the "report" action would be of little use, since sending such reports or
performing the resulting actions is already part of the abuse detection
software that commonly runs before the message is even delivered.</t>

<t>Instead, the "report" action is mainly useful when used in Sieve scripts
that are run as triggered by an IMAP event <xref target="IMAPSIEVE"/>. Then, the
Sieve script is executed as a direct result of user action in most cases.
Certain user actions, such as moving or copying a message into a particular
mailbox, can then be defined to have a special meaning. For example, placing a
message into the "Spam Report" mailbox could mean that the user reports the
message as unsolicited bulk mail. Conversely, placing a message in a mailbox
called "Ham Report" could mean that the user reports that the message is
erroneously classified as unsolicited bulk mail. Using the "report" action,
the Sieve script that is run as a result of these actions can convey the report
in the standard MARF format to the entity responsible for handling such
reports. This avoids the need for the user's MUA software to support the
MARF report format and the need to configure where the reports are to be sent.
</t>

<t>The "report" action is mainly intended to be used in Sieve scripts that
are controlled by the system administrator. Also, this extension is specific
to the Pigeonhole Sieve implementation for the Dovecot Secure IMAP server. It
will therefore most likely not be supported by web interfaces and GUI-based
Sieve editors.</t>

<section title="Conventions Used in This Document">
<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="KEYWORDS"/>.</t>
<t>Conventions for notations are as in <xref target="SIEVE"/> Section 1.1,
including use of the "Usage:" label for the definition of action and tagged
arguments syntax.</t>

Usage: report [":headers_only"] <feedback-type: string>
              <message: string> <recipient: string>
]]></artwork>
</figure>

<t>The "report" action is used to send a <xref target="MARF">Messaging Abuse
Reporting Format (MARF)</xref> report to the supplied recipient address.
The "report" action composes the MARF report (the "report message") based on
the provided arguments and the "triggering message" that Sieve is currently
evaluating. The envelope sender address on the report message is chosen by the
sieve implementation.</t>

<t>The "feedback-type" argument is used as the value for the "Feedback-Type"
field in the machine-readable "message/feedback-report" MIME part of the MARF
report message. The "feedback-type" string value must conform to the
<xref target="RFC2045">MIME "token" syntax</xref>.</t>

<t>The "message" argument is a <xref target="UTF-8">UTF-8</xref> string
specifying a human-readable text explaining the nature of the report. It is
directly used as the body of the first MIME part of the MARF report with content
type "text/plain".</t>

<t>By default, the MARF report includes the triggering message in its entirety
as its third MIME part. When the ":headers_only" tag is specified, it contains
only a copy of the entire header block from the triggering message. In that case
the MIME type of the third part is "text/rfc822-headers", rather than
"message/rfc822" <xref target="MARF"/>.</t>

<t>Since the "report" action is not normally used at message delivery, the
report message is not sent as a result of a newly delivered message. In such
cases, mail loops are very unlikely to occur. However, for the uncommon case
that the "report" action is used at message delivery, implementations MUST
always endeavor to avoid mail loops. To that end, implementations MUST always
include an "Auto-Submitted:" field <xref target="RFC3834"/> in the report
message. Furthermore, implementations MUST NOT allow sending report messages to
the mail account running this Sieve script.
</t>

<t>The "report" action is compatible with all other actions, and does not affect
the operation of other actions. In particular, the "report" action MUST NOT
cancel the implicit keep. Substitution of
<xref target="VARIABLES">variables</xref> is supported for all arguments.</t>

<t>Multiple executed "report" actions are allowed. However, only one report
message is sent for each unique combination of feedback type and report
recipient. Subsequent duplicate report actions are ignored without error and
only the human-readable message from the first instance of the duplicate action
is used in the report.</t>

<section title="Sieve Capability Strings">
<t>A Sieve implementation that defines the "report" action command
will advertise the capability string "vnd.dovecot.report".

<t>In this example, Victor receives some unsolicited bulk email at his
account "victim@example.org" and his mail filter failed to recognize it as such.
The message is delivered to his INBOX and looks as follows: </t>

<t>The administrator of Victor's email account has created a "Spam Report"
mailbox and has asked Victor to move any misclassified e-mail into that
mailbox. The following administrator-controlled Sieve script is linked to that
mailbox:</t>

<section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
<t>When used in IMAP context, the "report" command is executed for each
action and message that matches the criteria defined by the Sieve script. If
the user performs matching activities with a large volume of messages, a
great many reports can be sent at one time. Implementations and deployments MUST
be designed to cope with such incidents, either by limiting the number of
reports or by otherwise mitigating their collective impact.</t>
