<t>
This document defines new vendor-defined items for the "environment" extension
of the Sieve mail filtering language.
</t>
</abstract>
</front>

<middle>

<section title="Introduction">
<t>This document describes an extension to the Sieve filtering language defined
by <xref target="SIEVE">RFC 5228</xref>. This vendor-defined extension builds
upon the existing standard "environment" extension <xref target="ENVIRONMENT"/>,
which allows Sieve scripts to access information about their execution context,
such as the name and version of the Sieve interpreter implementation. The new
"vnd.dovecot.environment" extension adds a few more environment items that
can be accessed by Sieve scripts. Additionally, it makes the environment
items available directly as variables <xref target="VARIABLES"/>.</t>

<t>This extension is specific to the Pigeonhole Sieve implementation for the
Dovecot Secure IMAP server. It will therefore most likely not be supported by
web interfaces and GUI-based Sieve editors.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Conventions Used in This Document">
<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="KEYWORDS"/>.</t>
<t>Conventions for notations are as in <xref target="SIEVE"/> Section 1.1,
including use of the "Usage:" label for the definition of action and tagged
arguments syntax.</t>
</section>

<section title="Dovecot Environment Items">

<t>
The set of Dovecot-specific environment items is as follows:
<list style="hanging" hangIndent="6">
<t hangText="&quot;vnd.dovecot.default-mailbox&quot;">
<vspace />
The default mailbox that is used by the (implicit) keep action.
Normally, this will always yield "INBOX", unless this is changed in the
configuration.</t>
<t hangText="&quot;vnd.dovecot.username&quot;">
<vspace />
The username of the recipient for this particular message delivery.</t>
<t hangText="&quot;vnd.dovecot.config.*&quot;">
<vspace />
This environment item obtains its value from the mail server configuration.
The part of the environment item name after the "vnd.dovecot.config." prefix
is used as an identifier of the configuration setting. This will only be
able to access settings within a limited namespace, e.g. settings with a
particular identifier prefix.</t>
</list>
</t>
</section>

<section title="Variables Namespace env"> 

<t>This document defines the variables namespace "env", in accordance with
the "variables" extension document <xref target="VARIABLES"/>, Section 3. 
It makes environment items directly available as variables. Since environment
items are always read-only, variables in the "env" namespace can never be
modified.</t>

<t>Basically, the variable name for an environment item is composed of the
"env." namespace prefix followed by the full name of the environment item. This
is also true when the environment item name contains "." characters; those have
no special meaning within the "env" variables namespace. However, since a
variable name cannot contain "-" characters, any "-" character in the name of
the environment item is mapped to an "_" character. The environment item called
"vnd.dovecot.default-mailbox" is therefore available as the variable
"${env.vnd.dovecot.default_mailbox}".</t>

<t>Example:</t>
<?rfc needLines="3" ?>
<figure>
<artwork><![CDATA[
require ["variables", "fileinto", "mailbox"];
require "vnd.dovecot.environment";

fileinto :create "User\${env.vnd.dovecot.username}";

]]></artwork>
</figure>
</section>

<section title="Sieve Capability Strings">
<t>A Sieve implementation that supports the Dovecot-specific environment items
outlined in this document will advertise the capability string
"vnd.dovecot.environment". Note that "vnd.dovecot.environment" implies
"environment", and a script with "vnd.dovecot.environment" in a "require" list
can omit "environment" from that list.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
<t>All of the security considerations given in the base Sieve specification
<xref target="SIEVE"/> and the specification of the "environment" extension
<xref target="ENVIRONMENT"/> also apply to this extension. Some of the
environment items added by this extension are somewhat more sensitive than the
standard ones, so enabling this extension should be considered carefully.</t>
