1.  Introduction

   Currently, Sieve filters [SIEVE] can either be applied at initial
   mail delivery [SIEVE] or triggered by certain events in the Internet
   Message Access Protocol (IMAP) [IMAPSIEVE].  The user can configure
   which Sieve scripts to run at these instances, but it is not possible
   to trigger the execution of Sieve scripts manually.  However, this
   could be very useful; e.g, to test new Sieve rules and to re-filter
   messages that were erroneously handled by an earlier version of the
   Sieve scripts involved.

   This document extends IMAP [IMAP4rev1] with a new capability called
   "FILTER=SIEVE".  This adds a new generic "FILTER" command that allows

   applying a mail filter on a set of messages that match the specified
   searching criteria.  Although this command is defined such that it
   can be extended for use with any (future) mail filter language, this
   specification only adds support for invoking the "FILTER" command
   with Sieve filters.

   In examples, "C:" indicates lines sent by a client that is connected
   to a server.  "S:" indicates lines sent by the server to the client.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

   [FIXME]

3.2.  FILTER and UID FILTER Commands

   The FILTER=SIEVE extension adds the FILTER and UID FILTER commands.
   These allow clients to apply message filters to messages in the
   selected mailbox that match the given searching criteria.  These
   commands are only available in the selected state [IMAP4rev1].

   Arguments:  filter specification
               OPTIONAL [CHARSET] specification
               searching criteria (one or more)

   Responses:  REQUIRED untagged response: FILTERED

   Result:     OK - filter completed
               NO - command failure: can't search that [CHARSET] or
               criteria, or filter failed
               BAD - command arguments invalid

   The filter specification describes the filter that is to be applied
   to all matching messages.  It consists of an identifier for the
   filter type, followed by arguments specific to that filter type.

   This specification defines only the "SIEVE" filter type, which uses
   the Sieve Email Filtering Language [SIEVE].  The arguments of this
   filter are one of the following.  Refer to the Formal Syntax section
   for the precise syntactic definitions of the arguments.

   DELIVERY
      The Sieve filtering normally applied at delivery is applied to the
      matching messages.  This allows e.g. re-filtering messages that
      were handled wrong at actual delivery.  This at least means that
      the "active script" as configured through [MANAGESIEVE] is run for
      the matching messages.  Some installations apply certain Sieve
      rules in addition to (before or after) the user's active script
      which are outside the user's control.  These MAY also be applied
      for DELIVERY filtering.

   PERSONAL <script-name>
      The Sieve script with the specified name that is stored in the
      user's own personal (private) Sieve repository is applied to the
      matching messages.  Implementations that support ManageSieve
      [MANAGESIEVE] can use the PUTSCRIPT command to store named scripts
      in the personal repository.  This is the same repository from
      which the Sieve "include" control structure [SIEVE-INCLUDE]
      retrieves ":personal" scripts.  Implementations MUST restrict
      script names according to [MANAGESIEVE], Section 1.6.

   GLOBAL <script-name>
      The Sieve script with the specified name that is stored in the
      global (site-wide) Sieve repository is applied to the matching
      messages.  This the same repository from which the Sieve "include"
      control structure [SIEVE-INCLUDE] retrieves ":global" scripts.
      Implementations MUST restrict script names according to
      [MANAGESIEVE], Section 1.6.

   SCRIPT <script>
      The Sieve script provided in the string argument is compiled and
      executed for all the matching messages.  This is e.g. useful to
      test an individual Sieve rule, or apply a new rule to already
      delivered messages.  The argument MUST be a valid Sieve script
      [SIEVE].

   The server MAY refuse support for any of these filter specification
   types by returning a tagged "NO" response, which MAY include an
   appropriate response code, such as "NOPERM" [IMAP-RESPCODES].

   The purpose of the [CHARSET] specification and the searching criteria
   is essentially identical to corresponding arguments of the IMAP
   SEARCH command [IMAP4rev1].  The specified message filter is applied
   to all messages that match the provided searching criteria.

   The server first checks whether it can initialize the specified
   filter.  For the "SIEVE" filter type, the initialization would
   typically consist of retrieving and compiling the specified or
   implied Sieve script or scripts.  If this process fails, the FILTER

   command returns a tagged NO response.  In that case, the server
   SHOULD issue an untagged FILTER response first to provide a human-
   readable description of the filter problem.  Refer to Section 3.4 for
   details.

   Same as for the SEARCH command, if the server does not support the
   specified [CHARSET], it MUST return a tagged NO response (not a BAD).
   This response SHOULD contain the BADCHARSET response code, which MAY
   list the [CHARSET]s supported by theserver.  Note that the server
   MUST NOT send an untagged FILTER response in this case, because this
   failure is not related to filter processing.

   Once the filter is initialized successfully, the filter is applied to
   each matching message.  An untagged FILTERED response is sent by the
   server for each of those messages.  This response indicates the
   result of applying the filter to the corresponding message.  Refer to
   Section 3.3 for details.

   The (implicit) "keep" action of the Sieve filter [SIEVE] leaves the
   message in the mailbox it currently resides (the source mailbox).
   When the implicit keep is canceled (e.g., "discard", "redirect" or
   "fileinto" is executed) and the message is not explicitly stored into
   the source mailbox, it is marked with the \Deleted flag in the source
   mailbox.  Refer to Section 4 for details.

               per-message filter result

   The untagged FILTERED response may be sent as a result of a
   successful, partially successful, or unsuccessful FILTER or UID
   FILTER command specified in Section 3.2.  It is sent for each message
   that matched the searching criteria of the corresponding FILTER
   command and it indicates the success/failure result of applying the
   filter to that message.

   The FILTERED response starts with a message number.  Just like the
   untagged FETCH response, the message number is always a message
   sequence number, not a unique identifier [IMAP4rev1], even when the
   response is sent for a UID FILTER command.

   The message number is followed by the "FILTERED" label, which in turn
   is followed by a filter command correlator.  This contains the tag of
   the command that caused the response to be returned.  This can be
   used by a client to match a FILTERED response against a corresponding
   FILTER/UID FILTER command.

   When the FILTERED response is sent by the server in response to a UID
   FILTER command, the filter command correlator MUST be followed by the
   word "UID" followed by the unique identifier of the filtered message.
   This part of the response is optional when responding to a FILTER
   command.

   The FILTERED response ends with the filter result.  This indicates
   whether the filter was successfully applied to the message.  This
   specification defines the following results.

   OK
      The filter was applied successfully.

   WARNINGS <warnings>
      The filter was applied successfully, but there were one or more
      warnings produced by the filter, which likely indicates behavior
      not intended by the script writer.  The word "WARNINGS" is
      followed by a human-readable descriptive text listing the produced
      warnings.  A client seeing this filter result SHOULD present the
      returned warning text to the user.

   ERRORS <errors>
      Application of the filter failed for some reason.  The message is
      left in its original state (as if only the "keep" action was
      executed).  The word "ERRORS" is followed by a human-readable
      descriptive text listing the encountered errors.

3.4.  FILTER Untagged Response

   Contents:   filter command correlator
               general filter problem

   The untagged FILTER response may be sent as the result of a
   successful, partially successful, or unsuccessful FILTER or UID
   FILTER command specified in Section 3.2.  This response is used to
   provide filter error or warning details that are not specific to a
   particular message being filtered; e.g., errors or warnings occurring
   while the Sieve script is being compiled.  Implementations SHOULD
   avoid duplicating such output across all per-message FILTERED
   responses and issue a single FILTER response instead.  The server
   MUST NOT send more than a single FILTER response.  This untagged
   response MUST only be sent for problems that concern the filter
   processing.

   The FILTER response starts with the "FILTER" label, which is followed
   by a filter command correlator.  This contains the tag of the command
   that caused the response to be returned.  This can be used by a
   client to match a FILTER response against a corresponding FILTER/UID
   FILTER command.

   The FILTER response ends with a description of the problem that the
   filter encountered.  This specification defines the following
   problems.

   WARNINGS <warnings>
      The filter can be applied successfully (individual FILTERED
      responses provide per-message details), but there were one or more
      general warnings produced by the filter, which likely indicates
      behavior not intended by the script writer.  The word "WARNINGS"
      is followed by a human-readable descriptive text listing the
      produced warnings.  A client seeing this FILTER response SHOULD
      present the returned warning text to the user.

   ERRORS <errors>
      Application of the filter failed completely for some reason.  This
      MUST mean that no messages are affected by this filter command,
      which implies that no FILTERED responses are issued for this
      command.  Since filtering failed, the FILTER command MUST end in
      an tagged NO response when a FILTER ERROR response is issued.  The
      word "ERRORS" is followed by a human-readable descriptive text
      listing the encountered errors.

4.  Semantics of Sieve Actions

   Sieve is normally executed during message delivery and some Sieve
   actions therefore relate specifically to this context.  Much like the
   IMAPSIEVE capability [IMAPSIEVE], the FILTER=SIEVE capability allows
   executing Sieve scripts in IMAP for messages that are already
   delivered.  However, unlike the IMAPSIEVE capability, these are
   (parts of) the same Sieve scripts that are run at delivery, meaning
   that the execution of Sieve scripts for the FILTER=SIEVE capability
   needs to be very similar to execution during message delivery.  This
   means that Sieve scripts that are successfully executed during
   message delivery MUST also finish successfully when executed in the
   context of FILTER=SIEVE.

   One problem is that the SMTP envelope information required for some
   of the actions and tests is not or only partially available in IMAP.
   This will need to be reconstructed from the message and any envelope
   metadata that may be available in the message store.

   Additionally, it makes no sense to send response messages to the
   original sender when Sieve scripts are executed in IMAP, which may
   happen a long time after the message was originally delivered.
   Therefore, Sieve scripts executed by the FILTER=SIEVE script MUST NOT
   send any such responses.  Instead, the execution of such actions MUST
   silently be ignored or at least the submission of the response
   message MUST be inhibited.  Note that this explicitly MUST NOT
   trigger a runtime error, as explained above.

   This section describes how actions in the base Sieve specification,
   and those in extensions known at the time of this writing, relate to
   this specification.

   In addition to what is specified here, interactions noted in the
   individual specifications apply and must be considered.

4.1.  The "keep" Action

   Much like what normally happens during Sieve execution at delivery,
   the (implicit) "keep" action means that the message is treated as it
   would have been if no Sieve script were run.  For FILTER=SIEVE, this
   means that the message is left in the mailbox.  If actions have been
   taken that change the message, those changes are considered transient
   and MUST NOT be retained for any "keep" action (because IMAP messages
   are immutable).  No error is generated, but the original message,
   without the changes, is kept.

Internet-Draft        IMAP - FILTER=SIEVE Extension             May 2018


4.2.  The "fileinto" Action

   If the Sieve implementation supports the "fileinto" action, that
   action is executed in FILTER=SIEVE context very much like it normally
   would be during message delivery.  The message is COPIED into the
   fileinto mailbox, without removing the original.  In all cases,
   fileinto always creates a new message, separate from the original.
   If the "copy" extension [SIEVE-COPY] is available and the ":copy"
   option is specified, the implicit keep is retained; otherwise,
   "fileinto" cancels the implicit keep, as specified in the base Sieve
   specification [IMAPSIEVE].

   If a "keep" action is not also in effect, the original message is
   then marked with the \Deleted flag.

4.3.  The "redirect" Action

   The "redirect" action is executed in FILTER=SIEVE context very much
   like it normally would be during message delivery.  It causes the
   message to be sent, as specified in the base Sieve specification
   [IMAPSIEVE], to the designated address.  If the "copy" extension
   [SIEVE-COPY] is available and the ":copy" option is specified, the
   implicit keep is retained; otherwise, redirect cancels the implicit
   keep, as specified in the base Sieve specification.

   It is possible that a message processed in this way does not have the
   information necessary to be redirected properly.  It may lack
   necessary header information, and there may not be appropriate
   information for the MAIL FROM command.  In such cases, the "redirect"
   action uses message submission [SUBMISSION], and it is up to the
   Sieve engine to supply the missing information.  The redirect address
   is, of course, used for the "RCPT TO", and the "MAIL FROM" SHOULD be
   set to the address of the owner of the mailbox.  The message
   submission server is allowed, according to the message submission
   protocol, to perform necessary fix-up to the message (see Section 8
   of RFC 6409).  It can also reject the submission attempt if the
   message is too ill-formed for submission.

   If a "keep" action is not also in effect, the original message is
   then marked with the \Deleted flag.

4.4.  The "discard" Action

   The "discard" action is executed in FILTER=SIEVE context very much
   like it normally would be during message delivery.  If an explicit
   "keep" action is also in effect, the "discard" action does nothing.
   Otherwise, the original message is marked with the \Deleted flag.

4.5.  The "notify" Action

   If the Sieve "enotify" extension [SIEVE-ENOTIFY] is available, the
   "notify" action is executed as normal in FILTER=SIEVE context.  The
   result is that the requested notification is sent and that the
   message is otherwise handled as it would normally have been.

4.6.  The "addheader" and "deleteheader" Actions

   If the "editheader" extension [SIEVE-EDITHEADER] is available, it can
   be used to make transient changes to header fields, which aren't
   saved in place, such as for "redirect" or "fileinto" actions.
   Because messages in IMAP mailboxes are immutable, such changes are
   not applicable for the "keep" action (explicit or implicit).  See
   Section 4.1.

4.7.  The "setflag", "deleteflag", and "removeflag" Actions

   If the "imap4flags" extension [SIEVE-IMAP4FLAGS] is available, its
   actions are executed in FILTER=SIEVE context very much like these
   normally would be executed during message delivery.  However, since
   the message is already stored in a mailbox, the initial state of the
   internal flags variable is the list of currently assigned flags
   rather than the empty string.

4.8.  MIME Part Tests and Replacement

   If the MIME Part Tests extension [SIEVE-MIME] is available, all of
   its functions can be used in scripts executed in FILTER=SIEVE
   context, but any changes made to the message, using the "replace" or
   "enclose" action, MUST be considered transient and are only
   applicable with actions such as "redirect" and "fileinto".  Because
   messages in IMAP mailboxes are immutable, such changes are not
   applicable for the "keep" action (explicit or implicit).  See
   Section 4.1.

4.9.  The "imapsieve" extension

   Since the Sieve scripts for FILTER=SIEVE are not triggered as part of
   an IMAP event, the "imapsieve" extension [IMAPSIEVE] MUST not be
   available in FILTER=SIEVE context.  Using this extension in the
   "require" command MUST cause a compile error in FILTER=SIEVE context,
   just like it would for scripts compiled for message delivery.

4.10.  Ignored Actions

   The following actions are always ignored when the Sieve script is
   executed in FILTER=SIEVE context, because they are specifically
   designed to respond to delivery of a new email message:

         reject [IMAPSIEVE]

         ereject [SIEVE-REJECT]

         vacation [SIEVE-VACATION]

   Future extensions that are specifically designed to respond to
   delivery of a new email message will likewise need to be ignored.

4.11.  Future Sieve Actions

   As noted above, future extensions that are specifically designed to
   respond to delivery of a new email message will be ignored, because
   the FILTER=SIEVE capability does not involve acting at new-message
   delivery time.

   In general, future extensions to Sieve that define new actions MUST
   specify what behavioral differences there are when executing in
   FILTER=SIEVE context (if any).

5.  Semantics of Sieve Tests

   Any tests against message envelope information, including the
   "envelope" test in the Sieve base specification, as well as any such
   test defined in extensions, can have serious interoperability issues
   when performed at other than message delivery time.  Therefore,
   envelope information SHOULD be reconstructed as good as possible, so
   that the tests yield the same results in FILTER=SIEVE context as
   these would during message delivery.  Since this cannot be guaranteed
   for all implementations of FILTER=SIEVE, the Sieve script author
   SHOULD account for possible differences explicitly using the
   "environment" extension (See Section 6).

   Executing in FILTER=SIEVE context does not affect the operation of
   other tests or comparisons in the Sieve base specification.

   The remainder of this section describes how tests in extensions known
   at the time of this writing relate to this specification.

5.1.  The "hasflag" Test

   If the "imap4flags" extension [SIEVE-IMAP4FLAGS] is available, its
   "hasflag" test is executed in FILTER=SIEVE context very much like it
   normally would be executed during message delivery.  However, since
   the message is already stored in a mailbox, the initial state of the
   internal flags variable is the list of currently assigned flags
   rather than the empty string.

5.2.  The "spamtest" and "virustest" tests

   If the "spamtest" and "virustest" extensions [SIEVE-SPAMVIRUSTEST]
   are available, the associated tests are executed in FILTER=SIEVE
   context exactly as these normally would be executed during message
   delivery.

5.3.  The "duplicate" test

   If the "duplicate" extension [SIEVE-DUPLICATE] is available, the
   associated test is executed in FILTER=SIEVE context exactly as it
   normally would be executed during message delivery.

5.4.  Future Sieve Tests

   Future extensions to Sieve that define new tests MUST specify what
   behavioral differences there are when executing in FILTER=SIEVE
   context (if any).

6.  Interaction with Sieve Environment

   The Sieve "environment" extension [SIEVE-ENVIRONMENT] can be used to
   evaluate properties of the environment in which the Sieve script is
   executing.  When the FILTER=SIEVE capability is involved, this can be
   used by the script author to detect whether the script is executing
   at message delivery or at some later time in FILTER=SIEVE context.

6.1.  Base Sieve Environment Items: location and phase

   The Sieve Environment extension defines a set of standard environment
   items ([SIEVE-ENVIRONMENT], Section 4.1).  Two of those items are
   affected when the script is invoked in FILTER=SIEVE context.

   The value of "location" is set to "MS" -- evaluation is being
   performed by a Message Store.

   The value of "phase" is set to "post" -- processing is taking place
   after final delivery.

7.  Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification augments the grammar specified in
   [IMAP4rev1].  It uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation
   as specified in [ABNF].  Non-terminals not defined in this document
   can be found in [IMAP4rev1] and [IMAPABNF].

                         ; value conforms to Sieve script syntax defined
                         ; in [SIEVE], Section 8.2

   sieve-name         = astring
                         ; value conforms to Sieve script name syntax
                         ; defined in [IMAPSIEVE], Section 1.6


8.  Security Considerations

   The FILTER=SIEVE capability offers the means to execute named or
   literal Sieve scripts directly, without there being a trigger of some
   kind.  If users already have ManageSieve access, this does not add

Internet-Draft        IMAP - FILTER=SIEVE Extension             May 2018


   any obvious security concerns.  However, when ManageSieve is not
   available to users, the literal script could be used to access
   functionality that is normally not accessible by users.  For example,
   users could run a literal Sieve script that executes actions that are
   not available using the (web) UI that the user normally uses to
   configure mail filtering.  When this is a concern, the server MUST
   either refuse filter specification types other than "SIEVE DELIVERY"
   or limit the available Sieve functionality within the context of the
   FILTER command.

   Other security considerations are discussed in IMAP [IMAP4rev1] and
   Sieve [SIEVE], as well as in some of the other extension documents.

9.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to add "FILTER=SIEVE" to the "IMAP
   Capabilities" registry located at <http://www.iana.org/assignments/
   imap-capabilities>.
