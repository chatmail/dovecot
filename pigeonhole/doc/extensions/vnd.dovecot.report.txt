Vnd.dovecot.report Extension

Relevant specifications
=======================

  doc/rfc/spec-bosch-sieve-report.txt

Description
===========

The "vnd.dovecot.report" extension provides the means to send Messaging Abuse
Reporting Format (MARF) reports (RFC 5965). This format is intended for
communications regarding email abuse and related issues.  The "report" command
allows (partially) automating the exchange of these reports, which is
particularly useful when the Sieve script is executed for an IMAP event
(RFC 6785) that is triggered by direct user action.

Configuration
=============

The "vnd.dovecot.report" extension is not available by default; it needs
to be added to the sieve_extensions setting (or any of the alternatives).

The "vnd.dovecot.report" extension has its own specific settings. The following
settings can be configured for the vacation extension (default values are
indicated):

 sieve_report_from = postmaster
   Specifies what address is used for the "From:" header field in reports.
   The following values are supported for this setting:
   
     "postmaster"     - The postmaster_address configured for the LDA (default).
     "sender"         - The sender address is used.
     "recipient"      - The final recipient address is used.
     "orig_recipient" - The original recipient is used.
     "user_email"     - The user's primary address is used. This is
                        configured with the "sieve_user_email" setting. If
                        that setting is unconfigured, "user_mail" is equal to
                        "recipient".
     "<user@domain>"  - Redirected messages are always sent from user@domain.
                        The angle brackets are mandatory. The null "<>" address
                        not supported and interpreted as "postmaster".

Invalid values for the settings above will make the Sieve interpreter log a
warning and revert to the default values.

Example
=======

plugin {
  sieve = file:~/sieve;active=~/.dovecot.sieve

  sieve_report_from = <reporter@example.com>
}
