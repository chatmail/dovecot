Variables Extension

Relevant Specifications
=======================

  RFC5229 - doc/rfc/variables.rfc5229.txt

Description
===========

The Sieve "variables" extension adds the concept of variables to the Sieve
language.

Configuration
=============

The "variables" extension is available by default. The "variables" extension has
its own specific settings. The following settings can be configured for the
"variables" extension (default values are indicated):

sieve_variables_max_scope_size = 255
  The maximum number of variables that can be declared in a scope. There are
  currently two variable scopes: the normal script scope and the global scope
  created by the "include" extension. The minimum value for this setting is 128.

sieve_variables_max_variable_size = 4k
  The maximum allowed size for the value of a variable. If exceeded at runtime,
  the value is always truncated to the configured maximum. The minimum value for
  this setting is 4000 bytes. The value is in bytes, unless followed by a
  k(ilo).
