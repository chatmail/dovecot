LDAP Sieve Script Location Type

Description
===========

This location type is used to retrieve Sieve scripts from an LDAP database. To
retrieve a Sieve script from the LDAP database, at most two lookups are
performed. First, the LDAP entry containing the Sieve script is searched using
the specified LDAP search filter. If the LDAP entry changed since it was last
retrieved (or it was never retieved before), the attribute containing the actual
Sieve script is retrieved in a second lookup. In the first lookup, a special
attribute is read and checked for changes. Usually, this is the
`modifyTimestamp' attribute, but an alternative can be configured.

Note that, by default, compiled binaries are not stored at all for Sieve scripts
retrieved from an LDAP database. The bindir= option needs to be specified in the
location specification. Refer to the INSTALL file for more general information
about configuration of script locations.

Depending on how Pigeonhole was configured and compiled (refer to INSTALL file
for more information), LDAP support may only be available from a plugin called
`sieve_storage_ldap'.

Configuration
=============

If support for the LDAP location type is compiled as a plugin, it needs to be
added to the sieve_plugins setting before it can be used, e.g.:

sieve_plugins = sieve_storage_ldap

The script location syntax is specified as follows:

location = ldap:<config-file>[;<option>[=<value>][;...]]

The <config-file> is a filesystem path that points to a configuration file
containing the actual configuration for this LDAP script location.

The following additional location options are recognized:

  user=<username>
    Overrides the user name used for the lookup. Normally, the name of the
    user running the Sieve interpreter is used.

If the name of the Script is left unspecified and not otherwise provided by the
Sieve interpreter, the name defaults to `default'.

The configuration file is based on the auth userdb/passdb LDAP configuration
(refer to Dovecot wiki at http://wiki2.dovecot.org/AuthDatabase/LDAP). The
following options are specific to the Sieve ldap location type:

  sieve_ldap_filter = (&(objectClass=posixAccount)(uid=%u))
    The LDAP search filter that is used to find the entry containing the Sieve
    script.

  sieve_ldap_script_attr = mailSieveRuleSource
    The name of the attribute containing the Sieve script itself.

  sieve_ldap_mod_attr = modifyTimestamp
    The name of the attribute used to detect modifications to the LDAP entry.
	
Examples
========

plugin {
  sieve = ldap:/etc/dovecot/sieve-ldap.conf;bindir=~/.sieve-bin/
}

An example LDAP location configuration is available in this package as
doc/example-config/sieve-ldap.conf.
