dovecot (1:2.2.21-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  This release disables the dovecot.socket systemd unit by default. The unit is
  disabled only if the dovecot.service unit is already enabled, making sure
  that dovecot will start on system boot. If you are upgrading dovecot and
  previously relied on dovecot.socket and dovecot.service being both enabled,
  please re-enable dovecot.socket manually using

     systemctl enable dovecot.socket

  Future package updates will not disable the socket unit again. For details
  regarding this decision, please see Debian bugs #803915 and #814999.

dovecot (1:2.1.7-7) unstable; urgency=high

  If you are upgrading from stable or the earlier 2.1.7 packages in testing,
  you are advised to  backup your configuration files before continuing.
  Carefully read /usr/share/doc/dovecot-core/README.Debian.gz for important
  information about problems that might affect your upgrade.

dovecot (1:2.0.5-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * A lot of settings have changed. Dovecot v2.0 can still use most of
    the v1.x configuration files, but it logs a lot of warnings at
    startup. A quick and easy way to convert your old config file to
    v2.0 format is:

    doveconf -n -c dovecot-1.conf > dovecot-2.conf

    This command logs a warning about each obsolete setting it
    converts to the new format. You can either go through the warnings
    to figure out what changes exactly were done, or you can simply
    trust doveconf and replace your old config with the newly
    generated one.

  * Dovecot uses two system users for internal purposes now by
    default: "dovenull" and "dovecot". "dovenull" user is used by
    completely untrustworthy processes, while "dovecot" user is used
    for slightly more trusted processes.

  * In conf.d/10-mail.conf, the default mail_location is set to
    mbox:~/mail:INBOX=/var/mail/%u
    This has to be set because Dovecots auto-detection of mailboxes fails
    when a user has no mail.  I tried to provide a reasonable default
    but advanced users will certainly want to change this.

    Related to this, you might see an error in the logs about dovecot not
    being able to chgrp certain files.  This is because the default user
    mailboxes in Debian belong to group mail which dovecot is not part of
    (nor should be.)  The Debian package has been patched so that the error
    will not be fatal but for a more permanent solution, see here:
    http://wiki2.dovecot.org/Errors/ChgrpNoPerm  for some discussion.  Or
    you can set mail_location (and the equivalent settings in your MDA) so
    that mailboxes are in the users home directory.

  * No more convert plugin, use dsync instead

  * No more expire-tool, use doveadm expunge instead. Also expire
    configuration is different.

  * Post-login scripts are configured differently and need to be modified

  * Quota warnings are configured differently and the script may need
    to be modified (most environment settings like $USER are gone)

  * Global ACL filenames now require namespace prefix (e.g. if you use
    "INBOX." prefix, /etc/acls/foo needs to be renamed to
    /etc/acls/INBOX.foo

  * Maildir: Permissions for newly created mail files are no longer
    copied from dovecot-shared file, but instead from the mail
    directory (e.g. for "foo" mailbox, they're taken from
    ~/Maildir/.foo directory)

  * dbox: v2.0 format is slightly different, but backwards
    compatible. The main problem is that v2.0 no longer supports
    maildir-dbox hybrid resulting from "fast Maildir migration". If
    you have any Maildir files in your dbox, you need to convert them
    somehow (some examples). You might also consider using dsync to
    get rid of the old unused metadata in your dbox files.


  * Pre-login and post-login CAPABILITY reply is now
    different. Dovecot expects clients to recognize new automatically
    sent capabilities. This should work with all commonly used
    clients, but some rarely used clients might have problems. Either
    get the client fixed, or set imap_capability manually.

  * ManageSieve protocol was assigned an official port by IANA:
    4190. This is used by Pigeonhole by default now. If you want to
    listen also on the old 2000 port, see the example in
    /usr/share/doc/dovecot-common/wiki/ManageSieve.Configuration.txt.gz

  * deliver binary was renamed to dovecot-lda (but a symlink still
    exists for now)

  * deliver -n parameter was replaced by lda_mailbox_autocreate
    setting. The default also changed to "no".

  * deliver -s parameter was replaced by lda_mailbox_autosubscribe
    setting. The default is "no", as before.

dovecot (1:1.0.12-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * mail_extra_groups=mail setting is often used insecurely to give Dovecot
    access to create dotlocks to /var/mail directory. The setting has been
    replaced by mail_privileged_group and mail_access_groups.

dovecot (1.0.beta3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Starting from this release, dovecot-lda is included in dovecot-common.
    The previous executable deliver has been removed from the upstream 
    source package.
  * Other new features recently added include
    + vpopmail support
    + quota support
    + GSSAPI support
  * All these new features mean there are some configuration file changes 
    please review the default /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf and merge in any
    new bits.  (If you don't use any new features, your configuration should
    remain compatible.)

dovecot (1.0.alpha4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This is the 1.0alpha branch.  Once again there have been incompatible 
    changes to the syntax of /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf. 
  * The dovecot-common package now includes the zlib plugin for compressed
    mboxen.  Make sure you have mail_use_modules=yes in imap and/or pop3 
    section in /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf if you want to use this.

dovecot (0.99.20050712-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This is the 1.0stable development branch.  There have been major 
    changes and new features have been added so check your configuration 
    carefully.  In particular, /etc/dovecot/dovecot-mysql.conf and 
    /etc/dovecot/dovecot-pgsql.conf have been replaced by
    /etc/dovecot/dovecot-sql.conf .
