  * [e23a136] Just a quick upload to make dovecot buildable on non-linux
    platforms again. (Closes: #676817) I did it by removing the systemd
    build-dep altogether.  sd-daemon.[ch] is included in the source so if
    systemd is installed on a system, it should be detected and socket
    activation should happen.  That is, assuming I've got everything right
    (and documented) which is something I'll be looking into for the next
    version.

        messages to the fts database.
      + added "doveadm director dump" command.
      + pop3: Added support for showing messages in "POP3 order", which can
        be different from IMAP message order. This can be useful for
        migrations from other servers. Implemented it for Maildir as 'O'
        field in dovecot-uidlist.
      - doveconf: Fixed a wrong "subsection has ssl=yes" warning.

  * dovecot-common: Allow STARTTLS to work when dovecot is run from inetd
    Thanks Magnus Holmgren (Closes: #290985)
  * dovecot-common: let init script exit if dovecot is being run from inetd
    Thanks Magnus Holmgren (Closes: #292195)
  * dovecot-common: fix a number of problems in postinst
    + fails if /etc/ssl/certs or /etc/ssl/private doesn't exist
    + certs cannot be generated and upgrade fails if openssl is not
      configured.  Fail more gracefully if this is the case.
    + read the name and path for the cert from dovecot.conf instead of
      hardcoding it.
      Thanks Frederic Pauget (Closes: #292344)

dovecot (0.99.13-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * dovecot-imapd, dovecot-pop3d:  It occurred to me that the effects of 
    fixing #288391 will cause confusion in the minds of new installers so I 
    should add a warning in README.Debian and NEWS.Debian in a vain 
    effort to stave off swarms of bug reports.  (Vain, because no one 
    actually reads documentation anyway.)
