/* The wrapper output stream allows turning any form* of activity involving data
   output into a standard Dovecot output stream. The wrapper output stream can
   operate both in blocking and non-blocking mode. When the wrapped activity is
   non-blocking, a blocking wrapper output stream will implicitly run its own
   ioloop.

   It is possible to have the wrapper output stream object available even before
   the data can be written anywhere, even before any form of output object (a
   connection) exists. In that case, any data written to the wrapper stream is
   buffered until the buffer is full. Once that happens, the stream will block
   or refuse writes until the underlying output becomes available.

   The wrapper output stream is not meant to be used directly. Instead, it is
   to be used as part of the implementation of an application-specific output
   stream. The wrapper output stream serves as the means to prevent code
   duplication between similar output stream implementations. It defines several
   methods that need to be implemented by the application-specific output
   stream.

   * Currently, the wrapper stream still expects an output stream object when
     data is to be written somewhere, but that should be easily circumvented
     once such behavior is needed (FIXME).
