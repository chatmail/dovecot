   automatically freed when the e_*() call is finished. Because this makes the
   freeing less obvious, it should be avoided outside e_*()'s event parameter.

   The passthrough events also change the API to be more convenient towards
   being used in a parameter. Instead of having to use e.g.
   event_add_str(event_set_name(event_create(parent), "name"), "key", "value")
   the event_passthrough API can be a bit more readable as:
   event_create_passthrough(parent)->set_name("name")->
   add_str("key", "value")->event(). The passthrough event is converted to
   a normal event at the end with the event() call. Note that this API works
   by modifying the last created passthrough event, so it's not possible to
   have multiple passthrough events created in parallel. */
