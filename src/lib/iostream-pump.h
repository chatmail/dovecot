/**

iostream-pump
=============

This construct pumps data from istream to ostream asynchronously.

The pump requires you to provide completion callback. The
completion callback is called with success parameter to
indicate whether it ended with error.

The istream and ostream are reffed on creation and unreffed
on unref.
